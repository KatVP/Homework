**Part a**

Solving the system of equations via matrices:

Enter the equations as matrices, with the coefficients of the variables as matrix a and the coefficients of the solutions as matrix b:
```{r}
a <- matrix(c(2,1,5,3),nrow = 2,ncol = 2)
b <- matrix(c(33,19),nrow = 2,ncol = 1)
```
Solve the matrices:

```{r}
solve(a,b)
```
The value of x is 4 and the value of y is 5.

Solving the system of equations "by hand"

Separate one of the variables to one side of each equation

2x = 33 - 5y
x = 19 - 3y

Divide by the multiplier of each separated variable

x = 33/2 - (5/2)y
x = 19 - 3y

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1 and group like terms

(33/2 - 19) + (3 - 5/2)y = 0

```{r}
(33/2) - 19
3 - (5/2)
```
-2.5 + 0.5y = 0

Move the variable to one side of the equation

0.5y = 2.5

Divide by the multiplier of the variable to solve

```{r}
2.5/0.5
```
y = 5

Now input this value into one of the equations to solve for the other variable

x + 3y = 19
x + 3*5 = 19

```{r}
19 - 3*5
```
x = 4

So, the solution to this system of equations is x = 4 and y = 5.


**Part b**

Create a vector that goes from 1 to 100
```{r}
x <- 1:100

```

Calculate the sum of the vector

```{r}
sum(x)
```
Calculate the number of terms in the vector
```{r}
length(x)
```
Divide the sum of the vector by the number of terms
```{r}
sum(x) / length(x)
```
The average of the vector is 50.5


**Part 3**

Creating a matrix with the given letters as the components, with 2 rows and 4 columns
```{r}
mat <- matrix(c("A","B","C","D","D","E","F","G"), ncol = 4, byrow = TRUE)
mat
```
Asking the dplyr package to turn the matrix into a data frame
```{r}
dataframe <- as.data.frame(mat)
dataframe
```
